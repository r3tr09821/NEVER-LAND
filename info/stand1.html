                    <p><h3>The Games of Wacky Willy</h3><br>
&nbsp &nbsp A domain ruled by Mr. Willy, where legend has it that no one has ever won — not a single game.<br>
Some whisper that Willy cheats, rigging the odds in his favor. Others swear there’s a curse that dooms every challenger to failure.<br>
But many don’t even try anymore. His fierce temper keeps most away, and the few brave souls who dare speak of his aggressive nature.<br>
<br>
Last Halloween, a heated brawl broke out between Willy and a challenger—<br>
but despite his wild spirit, Willy was bested by a far stronger opponent.<br>
Now, the air around his games feels even more charged, as if the legend itself is watching, waiting.</p>
